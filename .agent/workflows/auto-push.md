description: Automatically push code changes after development steps

// turbo-all
Whenever a feature is completed, a bug is fixed, or a significant change is made:
1. Stage all changes: `git add .`
2. Commit with a descriptive message: `git commit -m "feat/fix: <description>"`
3. Push to the main branch: `git push origin main`
